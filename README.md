# Talk2Me API

Server code for the API to power a tinderfication of problems. Users create an account and post a problem they are having, users then browse other users problems and swipe right if they believe they can help, this then opens a chat window.

Hacked together over a few hours for a proposed solution to the [SpunOut](www.spunout.ie) and [DUCSS](www.ducss.ie) hackathon 2014 in aid of mental health awareness.

The API is live at http://talktome-spunout.herokuapp.com
